# Infinite Loop Fixes

## Problem Identified
The storytelling application had multiple infinite loop issues that could prevent users from exiting the application properly:

1. **Story Session Loop**: The main story session loop (`_story_session` method) would continue indefinitely if errors occurred during story processing
2. **User Approval Loop**: The scenario approval loop could become stuck without proper interrupt handling
3. **Main Menu Loop**: The main menu didn't handle KeyboardInterrupt properly
4. **Input Handling**: Various input prompts lacked proper interrupt handling

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Story Session Error Handling
**Location**: `cli/interface.py:365-383`
- Added error recovery options when story processing fails
- Users can now choose to:
  - `(r)etry`: Try the same input again
  - `(s)ave and quit`: Save session and exit
  - `(c)ontinue`: Continue with a new input
- Prevents infinite loops when API calls fail or other errors occur

### 2. KeyboardInterrupt Handling
**Locations**: Throughout `cli/interface.py`
- Added proper `KeyboardInterrupt` handling to all major loops and input prompts
- Added `EOFError` handling for input stream closure
- Ensures session saving before exit in all interrupt scenarios

### 3. Main Menu Safety
**Location**: `cli/interface.py:69-103`
- Wrapped main menu loop in try/catch for KeyboardInterrupt
- Auto-saves current session before exiting
- Provides clean exit messages

### 4. Input Prompt Safety
**Locations**: Multiple locations in `cli/interface.py`
- Added interrupt handling to:
  - Scenario creation input
  - Scenario refinement input
  - User approval prompts
- All inputs now handle Ctrl+C gracefully

### 5. Enhanced User Experience
- Added clear user feedback when interrupts occur
- All interruptions save current session state
- Improved error messages and recovery options

## Files Modified
- `src/cli/interface.py`: Main interface fixes
- `src/test_fixed_app.py`: Test script for verification
- `src/INFINITE_LOOP_FIXES.md`: This documentation

## Testing
Use the test script to verify the fixes:
```bash
python src/test_fixed_app.py
```

The application should now:
1. Allow Ctrl+C interruption at any prompt
2. Provide error recovery options
3. Save sessions before exiting
4. Handle all edge cases gracefully

## Key Benefits
- **No more infinite loops**: All loops can be properly terminated
- **Better error handling**: Users have options when errors occur
- **Data safety**: Sessions are saved before unexpected exits
- **User control**: Users can interrupt and exit at any time
